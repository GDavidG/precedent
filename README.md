History
=========

Recognition. Recognition of law was based on kinship and contractual reciprocities motivated by the benfits of individual rights and private property. Indeed, a "mental codification of abstract rules" existed, so that legal decisions were part of a "going order"(Benson, Citing Popisil, Anthropology of Law: A Comparative Theory). Grammatical phrases or references to specific customs, precedents, or rules were present in all adjudication decisions that Popisil observed. He concluded: "not only does a legal decision solve a specific case, but it also formulates an ideal - a solution intended to be utilized in a similar situation in the future. The ideal component binds all other members of the group who did not particiapte in the case under consideration. The [adjudicator] himself turns to his previous decisions for consistency. In a way, they also bind him. Lawyers speak in such a case about the binding force of precedent."(Id.)

Externalities and Public Goods

The externality argument for public provision of law and order mught be characterized this way. private sector production of law and law enforcement generates external benefits for which private suppliers may be unable to charge. Suppose that a few individuals hire a private security firm to patrol their neighborhood. The patrol deters criminals, both for those who the the firm and those who do not. Thus, there are strong free-rider incentives at work here. If everyone paid for the benefits received, the firm would patrol more often and prevent more crime; but because individuals can reap benefits without paying, they have strong incentives not to enter into the neighborhood group that hired the firm. Even many strong free market advocates have accepted the validity of this argument.

If there is a significant free-rider problem, it means that too little private sector protection is purchased and produced. The problem arises because individuals cannot be persuaded to cooperate in buying the good or service in question, not because the private sector would not produce it if producers were fully compensated for the benefits that they provide. Professor Richard Epstein concluded:

In essence the entire system of governance presupposes that in a state of nature there are two, and only two failures of the system of private rights. The first is the inability to control private aggression, to which the police power is the proper response. The second is that voluntary transactions cannot generate the centralized power needed to combat private aggression. There are transaction costs, holdout and free-rider problems that are almost insurmountable when the conduct of a large number of individuals must be organized. To this problem, the proper response is the power to force exchanges upon payment for public use.

This argument has been used to a greater or lesser degree to justify the historical trend of increasing production of such services to supplement or replace private sector production efforts.

**A similar rationale has been made to justify the public provision of courts. Perhaps the most widely claimed external benefit of court decisions is the body of law or precedents that court decisions generate. Mabry, et., for instance, wrote that "the continuous creation of a collection of decisions, interpretations, opinions, and precedents is the production of a collectively consumed service. ... Since they are available to others at no additional cost, precedents are externalities. Indeed the entire set of law known as common law has developed as an external benefit of past adjudication. While individuals would be willing to pay for the private benefits they obtain from a private court (e.g. dispute resolution, restitution), they would be the only benefits considered. The failure to recognize and capture payment for additional benefit accruing to the community at large implies that suppliers in a private market would be unwilling to provide enough judicial services to maximize the net benefits of adjudication.

A similar but perhaps even more fundamental externality argument is put forth by even the staunchest supporters of the market economy. F. A. Hayek, for instance, argued that "government becomes indispensible...in order to see that the mechanism which regulates the production of...goods and services is kept in working order...it provides an essential condition for the preservation of...overall order." Clearly defined property rights are critical requirements for the operation of a market system, so some system of defining and then protecting and enforcing property rights is needed before a market economy can develop. Enforcement of property rights, it is suggested, requires coercion, and only the government is widely viewed to have coercive powers. The establishment of laws and a mechanism for their enforcement, therefore, has the beneficial external effect of allowing the market economy to develop and function. Because no private individual who might benefit from laws and their enforcement would be able to charge for all the benefits generated, too few laws and too little enforcement would develop without government. Besides, individuals would not freely grant other individuals the power to coerce.

It could be contended that the existence of nonexclusionary external benefits makes laws and law enforcement "public goods." And they are, given Samuelson's delineation of the domain of public goods: "A public good is one that enters two or more persons' utility. What are we left with? With a knife-edge pole of the private good case, and with all the rest of the world in the public good domain by virtue of involving some consumption externality." As Goldin pointed out, however, the theory of public goods "is dangerous and misleading theory if it suggests to the unwary that government services should be handled as if they were public goods." The efficient provision of goods that generate benefits requires cooperation, but cooperation does not always require government. Whenever external benefits exist, there are tremendous incentives to internalize them. Consequently, voluntary cooperation occurs daily in the private sector. Every market transaction involves cooperation between the buyer and seller, every good or service produced requires the voluntary cooperation of input suppliers, and every contract is a formal agreement to cooperate. A major distinction between government and private sector is the means used to induce cooperation.

Courts

**A typical "efficiency" argument for courts has been stated by Landes and Posner:

because of the difficulty of establishing property rights in a precedent, private judges may have little incentive to produce precedents. They will strive for a fair result between the parties in order to preserve a reputation for impartiality, but why should they make any effort to explain the result in a way that would provide guidance for future parties? To do so would confer an external, an uncompensated benefit, not only on future parties but also on competing judges. If anything, judges might deliberately avoid explaining their results because the demand for their services would be reduced by rules that, by clarifying the meaning of the law, reduce the incidence of disputes.

As Friedman commented, this argument "shows insufficiency of ingenuity" in envisioning the system of private courts that would probably arise. Indeed, Landes and Posner cited evidence contradicting their own arguments. For instance, they contended that "a problem is that a system of voluntary adjudication is strongly biased against the creation of precise rules of any sort," but then observed that "precise rules are familiar features of primitive legal systems." As explained, primitive law was privately adjudicated customary law. Landes and Posner also criticized private law for being too precise, preferring what they perceived to be the flexibility and potential for setting precedents of modern common law to the inflexible precision of primitive law. Such inflexibility, they predicted, would probably characterize private law today. Of course, this is simply not the case. If a primitive society was characterized by very few and very slow changes then the benefits of precision would far outweigh any advantage of extreme flexibility....

Landes and Posner argued that in a private judicial system judges are likely to "deliberately avoid explaining the results" in order to create demand for their services, although

private judges just might produce precedents...competitive private judges would strive for a reputation for competence and impartiality. One method of obtaining such a reputation is to give reasons for a decision that convince the disputants and the public that the judge is competent and impartial. Competition could lead private judges to issue formal or informal "opinions" declaring their interpretation of the law, and these opinions-though intended simply as advertising-would function as precedents, under a public judicial system.

Landes and Posner contended that this is an unlikely scenario because, in an effort to reduce costs, other methods of advertising would be sought. As with the policing function however, contractual organizations and surety arrangements would internalize the benefits of precedents. These organizations would either have their own judges or contract with judges who applied a clear set of rulings that would reduce future disputes. Under such an arrangement, maximizing profit does not involve maximizing the number of cases decided. A judge who provided clear rules and opinions would command a relatively high price for contracts with various organizations. Once under contract, the judge would actually have incentives to minimize the number of disputes that go to trial by making his rules clear-that is, by setting precedents. Under this scenario, private judges have precisely the opposite incentives to those predicted by Landes and Posner. Those judges who "tend to promulgate vague standards which hive each party to a dispute a fighting chance" would actually do less business.

The point is not that these internalization procedures arise in all private adjudication arrangements, but that institutions can be envisioned that produce incentives to write clear opinions and set precedents.

Furthermore, such institutions are likely to arise if they generate substantial benefits. Thus, Fuller contended that private arbitrators' incentives are diametrically opposed to those prposed by Landes and Posner. He proposed: "Being unbacked by state power... the arbitrator must concern himself directly witht he acceptability of his award. he may be at greated pains than a judge to get his facts straight, to state accurately the arguments of the parties, and generally to display in his award a full understanding of the case."

(This has yet to really touch on Law Making, and the preferability of evolutionary customary law generally)



There is another reason for demanding clear, well founded decisions. Smith referred to it as the "verification aspect." In order to satisfactorily end a dispute the decision must be acceptable-verifiable-not just ot the victim and offender but also to the groups or firms representing these parties and groups that might be drawn into a confrontation with one of the groups involved in the dispute. The willingness of other firms and organizations to enter into and honor reciprocal arrangements, such as extradition contracts, with those involved in the dispute depends in part on the way this and other disputes are handled. If an organization's disputes are submitted to judges whose opinions are not clear and well founded, then that organization will have problems influencing the choice of a judge and otherwise supporting their clientele in non-internal disputes.

Smith predicted that private courts would have to 1. allow citizen access to trials so third parties could observe proceedings (exceptions could arise if the parties in the suit had strong demands for privacy), 2. make details of that court's procedures accessible to any interested third party, and 3. make accurate records of a trial available to anyone who might want to review them. These predictions certainly seem to be supported by most historical examples of private courts. Popsil's description of trial procedures among the pimitive Kapauku, for instance, stressed the "public" nature of trials and the efforts that the tonowi took to firmly establish legal precedent for the solution to a dispute. Similarly, the medieval Icelandic, Anglo-Saxon, and Law Merchant courts were public forums. Even though a well publicized aspect of modern arbitration and rent-a-judge systems is their secrecy, this does not necessarily contradict Smith or the historical evidence that supports him. After all, what we see today is a relatively limited system of private courts. Those disputants who have a strong desire for privacy cannot get it from public courts, so they may have the strongest incentives to employ private courts today. Under complete privatization, there will be many disputes that demand clear decisions for public scrutiny.

Mechanics
=========

Arbitrators can opt to require PrecedentCoins from their customers in order to support the PrecedentProtocol. If done in accordance with the requirements of the Precedent Protocol, arbitrators are then awarded additional PrecedentCoins upon the publication of their decision in a given dispute. One can imagine the following example of this mechanism in action.

A and B have a contractual arrangement stipulating that disputes will be heard by an Arbitrator C. Their agreement also stipulated that they would pay the arbitrator some fee, a portion of which must be paid in PrecedentCoin.
Now, A has suffered some injury as a result of Bs conduct. (A cannot resort to resititutive measures against B on his own, as doing so may be construed as an initiation of force against B, thus A, as previously agreed, brings his dispute to Arbitrator C for resoltution in line with C's prior decisions).
