  "Obscure and incoherent legislation can make legality unattainable by anyone, or at least unattainable without an unauthorized revision which itself impairs legality."
  
  "One could write a history of the decline of the Rule of Law ... in terms of the progressive introduction of these vague formulas into legislation and [adjudication], and of the increasing arbitrariness and uncertainty of, and the consequent disrespect for, the law and judicature." - F.A. Hayek, The Road to Serfdom
